## Introduction
The national rate of drug overdose deaths over the last decade is increasing rapidly. The idea behind my project is to analyze data to see whether these deaths are linked to opiates prescriptions or opioids used as recreational. Can we see any correlation between these deaths and the rate of opiates prescribing? 

## Data Questions
1. Is there a trend showing the increase in opioid overdose deaths and the rate of opioid prescriptions by providers?
2. What's the difference between deaths related to synthetic/illegal opioids used for recreational that are not prescribed by providers with those caused by prescription opioids?

## Analysis



### Data Sources
1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has available data for drug overdose deaths since 2014-2017.  
2. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provides data for opioid prescribing rates of healthcare providers since 2014-2017.
