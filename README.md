## Introduction
As of  October 16, 2017, the National Institutes of Health declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993682/
The national rate of drug overdose deaths over the last decade is increasing rapidly. The idea behind my project is to analyze data to see whether these deaths are linked to opiates prescriptions or illegal opioids. Is there a correlation between the death count and the opiates prescription count? 

## Background
After taking care of patients with a drug addiction, celebrating their success stories but yet losing some to the epidemic, I’m always left questioning.  
1. What can I do with the knowledge & experience I have to help tackle this problem?
2. How can I use data to educate myself and the community about the epidemic?


## Data Questions
1. What is the national drug overdose death count?
2. What is the opioid overdose death count compared to the national count? And, what’s the comparison between males and females?
3. What is the impact of prescription opioids & synthetic opioids (fentanyl & heroin) on the overall overdose death count?

### Data Sources
1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has available data for drug overdose deaths since 2014-2017.

2. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provides data for opioid prescribing rates of healthcare providers since 2014-2017.

## Conclusion/Recommendations
1. The Federal Government should mandate States to improve overdose deaths reporting. Prompt reporting will help reduce data quality issues. Having real time data will also assist the law enforcement target States in need combat the illegal production and distribution of illegal drugs especially fentanyl.

2. The Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) should develop a system where a patient prescription information can be accessed by all providers nationwide. This can be designed to access prescription history of controlled/scheduled drugs only linked with a social security number.
